# Estimation-Theory-Maximum-Likelihood-Least_square_Error_Estimation
Solving a few Estimation Theory problems, using Matlab
Hi
This is an estimation theory assignment from KN Toosi university of Technology, Iran, Tehran. Prof. Saeed Khankalantari. Teaching Assistant Mohamad Ghashangzadeh.
This assignment requires a basic knowledge of Estimation Theory, and Matlab programming Language.
Problem 1, utilizes Newton-Raphson method for estimating the maximum of a given equation. And for different initial values it demonstrates the inability of Newton-Raphson method.
Problem 2, utilizes the Maximum Likelihood to estimate the unknown parameters of the Equation x(n). Actually the unknown parameters here are the frequencies [5, 10, 15, 20]. We want to estimate them.
Problem 3, Using LSE(Least Square Error) Estimator, Estimate the unknown Parameters A1 and A2, From the signal s(n) which exhibits noisy measurement.
